# Genetic Algorithm for Flower Evolution ðŸŒ¸

## **Project Overview:**
This project uses a **Genetic Algorithm** (GA) to simulate the evolution of flowers with randomly generated attributes such as size, color, and number of petals. The flowers evolve over multiple generations using **selection**, **crossover**, and **mutation** techniques to improve fitness based on hover time. 

## **Technologies and Tools Used:**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pygame
- **Algorithms**: Genetic Algorithm, Crossover, Mutation, Selection

## **Team Members:**
- **Sara Khaled**
- **Lojain Elsalanty**
- **Ahmed Mosad**
